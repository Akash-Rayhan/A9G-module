Tracking system using A9G module. Here we use  localhost. Hit the command "ssh -R 80:localhost:8000 ssh.localhost.run" on your pc. This will allow remote clients and this will forward all connections from gateway's port 8000 to internal host port 80. If the gateway has live internet address this will allow anyone to the web server. Make sure your pc is connected to router not any mobile network
